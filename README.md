# CA2

## Usage

This program includes an interactive mode (i.e., a command shell) for experimentation and entertainment. It provides means for generating and simulating cellular automata, as well as reading and writing to local files. Data can be passed (piped) from one command to another using the `>` operator. Most of the commands automatically handle special cases or extensions of the basic objects generated by other commands, such as collections/sets of states or simulations.

This is a non-exhaustive list of commands that can be run in the tool's interactive mode:

- `randomstate -n [int] -w [int] -h [int]`: Randomly generate a set of cellular automata states
- `simulate [rule] -i [int] -r auto`
- `sort [property]`
- `write [path]`: Store a human-readable text summary of the data (state(s), simulation(s), etc.) passed to the command at the specified filepath
- `save [path]`
- `abbr short long`: Create an abbreviation that will be expanded before a command is run, similar to preprocessor directives and macros in C
- `help`: Display this list
