# CA2

## Usage

This program includes an interactive mode (i.e., a command shell) for experimentation and entertainment. It provides means for generating and simulating cellular automata, as well as reading and writing to local files. Data can be passed (piped) from one command to another using the `>` operator. Most of the commands automatically handle special cases or extensions of the basic objects generated by other commands, such as collections/sets of states or simulations.
